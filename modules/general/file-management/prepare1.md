## File Management 

- [MDN Dealing with Files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files)

**File Management** describes the way you name and save the files you create. There is a hierarchical file system with folders or directories and files inside them. File management show how we arrange these nested folders and files.

The following video shows how you can use VSCode to manage your files. It continues where the video in the Introduction left off.

## File Management with VSCode

## Example

To reference our main.css file from the index.html file that we created with the file structure from the video we would use the following path:

```html
styles/main.css
```

Because index.html is at the root level of our project folder and main.css is inside the styles folder. We'd have to reference the folder and the file inside the styles folder called main.css.

We will get more practice on how to reference file paths from within code as we start HTML and CSS later.
