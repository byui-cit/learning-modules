## Description

It turns out that requesting information for a webpage after it has loaded in the browser from a web server is a very useful thing to do. It dramatically increases the possibilities of what we can do with web applications. [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) is the tool we will be using in order to do this.
