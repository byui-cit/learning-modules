## Description

The Document Object Model is actually not really Javascript. It is an API (application programming interface) provided by the browser. This API provides Javascript with a bunch of built in functions it can use to interact with the DOM. These functions are available in all browsers.

The DOM is the representation of the nodes or elements of a web page in code. The DOM is exposed through special objects to Javascript: ie `document`, `window`.

## Prepare

- [Manipulating Documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents): Read though the section "Getting useful information from the Window object"
- [What is Fetch and AJAX?](prepare1/)

## Ponder

- [Practice with the DOM](ponder1/)
