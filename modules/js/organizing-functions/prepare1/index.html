<h2 id="organization-and-access" tabindex="-1">Organization and Access <a class="direct-link" href="#organization-and-access" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>All computer languages are ways to organize your communication and thinking. In this, they are very similar to spoken languages. Each spoken language, or family of spoken languages, does this organization differently. English sentences often have a structure of Subject-Helper Verb-Verb-Predicate...The boy will bite the dog, for example. German, a language closely related to English, organizes things differently. Sometimes German sentences have a Subject-Helper Verb-Predicate-Verb structure... Ich werde das Buch bald lesen, which if translated word-by-word is &quot;I will the book soon read.&quot; Spanish has adjectives after the nouns they modify.</p>
<p>While each language has its own organizational rules, they all do the same thing. They allow us to organize and express our thinking.</p>
<h2 id="built-in-functions" tabindex="-1">Built in Functions <a class="direct-link" href="#built-in-functions" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Functions are used all over the place. Certain tasks are so common to development in fact that they are added to the language for all to use instead of forcing the developer to recreate the wheel over and over. If you have ever added an item to an array with <code>push()</code> you have used one of these pre-built function provided as part of JavaScript. If you need a review of some of the other built in functions for Arrays visit <a href="../../array-methods/">Array Built in methods</a>.</p>
<h2 id="functions-a-fundamental-organization-concept-of-javascript" tabindex="-1">Functions - a fundamental organization concept of JavaScript <a class="direct-link" href="#functions-a-fundamental-organization-concept-of-javascript" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Python and JavaScript, being related languages, both have functions as a fundamental organizational structure. When you truly begin thinking in JavaScript, you will be thinking in functions. You will think of how functions are related to each other. You will have thoughts along these lines, &quot;If this function calls that one...&quot; You will be able to do this since you will eventually realize that when you are designing solutions in JavaScript, how a function accomplishes something is not as important as that it will, and that you can wait to figure out how to complete the function later.</p>
<h3 id="well-built-functions" tabindex="-1">Well built functions <a class="direct-link" href="#well-built-functions" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>A well thought out and constructed function should be rather small. A function should ideally do <strong>one</strong> thing, and do it well. As you are writing functions, stop often to evaluate how many different things your functions are being asked to do. If the list becomes long, stop and break some of the functionality out into another function.</p>
<h2 id="declaring-functions" tabindex="-1">Declaring functions <a class="direct-link" href="#declaring-functions" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>In Python and JavaScript there are similarities and differences between the languages regarding how you declare functions. In JavaScript, the 'function' keyword is used instead of 'def'. Also, JavaScript the convention usually used for names of functions and variables is called 'camel case'. To create a name, the first word of the name starts with a lower-case letter, and the first letter of all the rest of the words making up the name begin with an upper-case letter. For example, a function that averages two numbers could be defined like this.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">averageTwoNumbers</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">firstNum<span class="token punctuation">,</span> secondNum</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>firstNum <span class="token operator">+</span> secondNum<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">/</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice the '{' and '}' operators. These are the JavaScript scope operators. These are used instead of the white-space scope operator used in Python. In JavaScript, white space means nothing but when writing your code, it is important to use white space to help make your code easier to read. Never left justify your code.</p>
<p>As with Python, JavaScript functions can have more than one line of code. The previous example could be written as</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">averageTwoNumbers</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">firstNum<span class="token punctuation">,</span> secondNum</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">let</span> sum <span class="token operator">=</span> firstNum <span class="token operator">+</span> secondNum<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">let</span> avg <span class="token operator">=</span> sum <span class="token operator">/</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">return</span> avg<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>It does exactly the same thing, it's just broken up into multiple lines of code. There is something of great importance to note in his little example. JavaScript and Python share the same scope rules. When let or const are used within the scope operators in JavaScript, the variable or constant exists only within that scope. In other words, the sum and avg variables declared between the scope operators for this function can not be used outside of this function.</p>
<p>JavaScript does have another keyword, var, that can be used to 'hoist' the variable outside of its declaring scope, but it can cause logic errors in your code and has fallen out of favor with most developers and engineers. You should rarely use it, and only when you have a great deal of experience with JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="another-way-to-write-functions" tabindex="-1">Another way to Write Functions <a class="direct-link" href="#another-way-to-write-functions" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Having seen the traditional way of declaring a function, it is important that you know there are other ways to create functions. In JavaScript functions are Objects. That means that anything we can do with an Object, we can do with a function. Including assigning them to variables. When we do this it is called a 'function expressions' in the JavaScript community. Here is the averageTwoNumbers function written using the expression type syntax.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">let</span> <span class="token function-variable function">averageTwoNumbers</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">firstNum<span class="token punctuation">,</span> secondNum</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">let</span> sum <span class="token operator">=</span> firstNum <span class="token operator">+</span> secondNum<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">let</span> avg <span class="token operator">=</span> sum <span class="token operator">/</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">return</span> avg<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>Regardless of if you used a function declaration or expression to create it, you would still call averageTwoNumbers using exactly the same syntax, averageTwoNumbers(15,10). So what then is the difference? Why would you choose one way over the other?</p>
<p>The JavaScript language has a concept called 'global scope'. When you use the traditional function declaration syntax, your function is created and lives in this global scope. An advantage of this is that you could write code using the function declaration that used the function BEFORE the function declaration like many other languages allow. Here's a simple, syntactically correct example.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token function">averageTwoNumbers</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">15</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br><span class="token comment">/*<br> *<br> * a bunch of other code goes here<br> *<br> */</span><br><br><span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">averageTwoNumbers</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">firstNum<span class="token punctuation">,</span> secondNum</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">let</span> sum <span class="token operator">=</span> firstNum <span class="token operator">+</span> secondNum<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">let</span> avg <span class="token operator">=</span> sum <span class="token operator">/</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">return</span> avg<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Wow. This does seem pretty good. It does come with a drawback. When the global space becomes too cluttered, the speed of code execution is impacted. Too many global functions produces slow code.</p>
<p>OK then, why not just use the expression syntax? If you tried to do this...</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token function">averageTwoNumbers</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">15</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br><span class="token comment">/*<br> *<br> * a bunch of other code goes here<br> *<br> */</span><br><br><span class="token keyword">let</span> <span class="token function-variable function">averageTwoNumbers</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">firstNum<span class="token punctuation">,</span> secondNum</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">let</span> sum <span class="token operator">=</span> firstNum <span class="token operator">+</span> secondNum<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">let</span> avg <span class="token operator">=</span> sum <span class="token operator">/</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">return</span> avg<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>your code will fail to run since the averageTwoNumbers function doesn't exist prior to calling it. To make it work you would need to do this instead.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">let</span> <span class="token function-variable function">averageTwoNumbers</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">firstNum<span class="token punctuation">,</span> secondNum</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">let</span> sum <span class="token operator">=</span> firstNum <span class="token operator">+</span> secondNum<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">let</span> avg <span class="token operator">=</span> sum <span class="token operator">/</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br>  <span class="token keyword">return</span> avg<span class="token punctuation">;</span><br><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br><span class="token comment">/*<br> *<br> * a bunch of other code goes here<br> *<br> */</span><br><span class="token function">averageTwoNumbers</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">15</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre>
<p>When you use the function expression syntax, the use of the function HAS to happen AFTER the function is created.</p>
<p>One question that usually comes up when using the expression syntax is, &quot;Hey...aren't we just storing a function in a variable? If so, could we change the function stored in the variable?&quot; The answer is yes though this is often an advanced JavaScript programming concept. If, on the other hand, your variable was a const instead of a let, no such change could be made.</p>
<p>So which way should we use to create functions? There are lots of opinions on that topic. This short article expresses one common opinion: <a href="https://gomakethings.com/function-expressions-vs-function-declarations/">function expressions vs function declarations</a>.</p>
