## Description

CSS is the language used to style an HTML document. CSS is a separate language from HTML. It describes how the
HTML should be displayed. Whereas HTML is about structure and what element is used for what content, CSS is all about
presentation and how the elements on the page will look and how they will be laid out on the page.
