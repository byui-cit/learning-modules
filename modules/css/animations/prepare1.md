## Why animations?

Animations can be a powerful tool for enhancing user experience and engagement on web pages. Watch the following short video which discusses some of the roles that animation can play in web sites.

 Here are some key reasons and scenarios when animations should be used:

- Improved User Experience: Animations can make web pages more visually appealing and interactive, capturing attention and guiding users through the content.
- Enhanced Engagement: Animations can create a more immersive experience, encouraging users to stay on the page longer and explore further.
- Improved Clarity: Animations can help clarify complex information or processes, making them easier to understand.

## What can be animated?

CSS has grown a lot over the years in it's ability to directly animate things. Not everything can be animated however. Take a look at [Lea Verou's Animatable website](http://leaverou.github.io/animatable/) to get a feel for all the properties that we can use.

## Examples

- Onboarding and Tutorials: Animations can visually guide users through new features or processes, making it easier to learn and adopt.
- Highlighting Key Information: Animations can draw attention to important elements on the page, such as calls to action or featured content.
- Providing Feedback: Animations can provide visual feedback to users, such as confirming actions or indicating progress.
- Creating a Sense of Movement: Animations can add a dynamic element to the page, making it feel more alive and engaging.

## Best Practices

- Keep it Simple: Avoid overly complex or distracting animations that can hinder user experience.
- Use Appropriate Timing: Ensure animations are not too fast or too slow, and that they don't disrupt the user's flow.
- Consider Accessibility: Make sure animations are accessible to users with disabilities, using appropriate ARIA attributes and alternative text.
- Test on Different Devices and Browsers: Ensure animations work as intended across different platforms and devices.
