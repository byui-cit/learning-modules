## Description

There are different ways to select the elements you want to style on your page with CSS. These include by element name and by class or ID name. But you can also select them based on their relationship to other elements or by a certain state that the element is in (pseudo). And depending on how you have targeted your elements some rules are more specific than others and it's important to understand this specificity order.
