# learning-modules

## Tag naming rules

All tags should be all lowercase. Check to see if the tag you want already exists and re-use as much as possible.

Only use tags in the index.md file for each module.

## creating a new learning module.

To create a new module you can copy the /modules/mod-template directory and paste it into whichever category folder you are building a module for. IE if I were building a new JS module I would copy mod-template and paste it into /modules/js

Then you should go in rename the folder to match the name of the module you are creating. Then you can edit the index.md file. Set the title, description, and tags first.

If your module can be communicated effectively in one page, the prepareX.md and ponderX.md files can be removed. More than one ponder or prepare file can be added as well as needed.
